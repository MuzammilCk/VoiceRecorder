### ‚ùì Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the transcription work?**
A: We use a dual approach - browser's Web Speech API for real-time transcription and OpenAI's Whisper API for high-accuracy post-processing. This gives users flexibility and the best of both worlds.

**Q: What about privacy and data security?**
A: All recordings are stored locally in the browser. API keys are stored locally and never sent to our servers. Only when using Whisper, audio is sent to OpenAI's secure servers.

**Q: How accurate is the transcription?**
A: Browser transcription is good for real-time feedback (80-90% accuracy), while Whisper provides 95%+ accuracy for final transcripts, especially for longer recordings.

**Q: What browsers are supported?**
A: Chrome provides the best experience, followed by Edge and Safari. Firefox has limited speech recognition support.

**Q: Can this be used commercially?**
A: The current version is for educational purposes. Commercial use would require proper licensing and compliance with API terms of service.

### üéØ Conclusion Points

1. **Innovation**: Successfully integrated multiple transcription technologies
2. **Usability**: Created an intuitive, professional interface
3. **Performance**: Optimized for speed and reliability
4. **Scalability**: Modular architecture allows for easy feature additions
