## Understanding Results

### Emotion Categories
- **üòä Happiness/Joy**: High energy, elevated pitch, positive vocal patterns
- **üò¢ Sadness**: Low energy, reduced pitch, subdued vocal characteristics
- **üò† Anger**: High energy, variable pitch, vocal tension indicators
- **üò∞ Fear/Anxiety**: Elevated pitch, brightness, nervous vocal patterns
- **üòå Calm/Neutral**: Balanced audio features, steady vocal patterns
- **‚ö° Excitement**: Very high energy, elevated pitch, dynamic vocal patterns

### Confidence Scores
- **90-100%**: Very high confidence, clear emotional indicators
- **70-89%**: High confidence, strong emotional patterns
- **50-69%**: Moderate confidence, some emotional indicators
- **30-49%**: Low confidence, weak emotional signals
- **Below 30%**: Very low confidence, unclear emotional state

### Audio Features Explained
- **Pitch**: Fundamental frequency of the voice (measured in Hz)
- **Energy**: Overall vocal intensity and volume level
- **Brightness**: Spectral centroid indicating voice clarity and sharpness
- **Voice Activity**: Zero-crossing rate showing vocal dynamics and articulation

## API Integration

### Hume AI Setup
1. Visit [hume.ai](https://hume.ai) and create an account
2. Generate an API key from your dashboard
3. Enter the API key in the Settings tab
4. Enable "Use Hume AI" toggle for enhanced analysis

### Local Analysis
- No API key required
- Uses advanced signal processing algorithms
- Provides immediate results
- Good for basic emotion detection and privacy-conscious users

## Technical Details

### Supported Audio Formats
- **WAV**: Uncompressed, highest quality
- **MP3**: Compressed, widely compatible
- **WebM**: Modern web format, good compression
- **OGG**: Open-source format, good quality
- **M4A**: Apple format, good compression

### File Limitations
- Maximum file size: 50MB
- Recommended duration: 10 seconds to 10 minutes
- Sample rate: 16kHz or higher recommended
- Mono or stereo channels supported

### Analysis Algorithms

#### Local Analysis Features
1. **Pitch Detection**: Autocorrelation-based fundamental frequency estimation
2. **Energy Calculation**: RMS energy computation for vocal intensity
3. **Spectral Analysis**: FFT-based spectral centroid for voice brightness
4. **Temporal Features**: Zero-crossing rate for vocal dynamics
5. **Emotion Inference**: Heuristic rules based on acoustic features

#### Emotion Mapping
- High pitch + High energy ‚Üí Happiness/Excitement
- Low pitch + Low energy ‚Üí Sadness
- High energy + High zero-crossing ‚Üí Anger
- High pitch + High brightness ‚Üí Fear/Anxiety
- Balanced features ‚Üí Calm/Neutral

## Privacy and Security

### Data Handling
- Audio files are processed locally when using local analysis
- Hume AI analysis sends audio to external servers (encrypted)
- API keys are stored locally in your browser
- No audio data is permanently stored on external servers

### Best Practices
- Use local analysis for sensitive recordings
- Only use Hume AI for non-confidential content
- Regularly update your API keys
- Clear browser data to remove stored API keys

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Analysis Failed" Error
- **Cause**: Unsupported file format or corrupted audio
- **Solution**: Convert to supported format (WAV, MP3, WebM, OGG, M4A)

#### "File Too Large" Error
- **Cause**: Audio file exceeds 50MB limit
- **Solution**: Compress or trim the audio file

#### "API Key Required" Error
- **Cause**: Hume AI enabled but no API key provided
- **Solution**: Enter valid API key in Settings or disable Hume AI

#### Low Confidence Scores
- **Cause**: Poor audio quality, background noise, or unclear speech
- **Solution**: Use higher quality recordings with clear speech

#### "No Emotions Detected"
- **Cause**: Very neutral speech or technical audio issues
- **Solution**: Try different audio or check file quality

### Performance Tips
- Use high-quality audio recordings for better results
- Ensure clear speech without background noise
- Keep recordings between 10 seconds to 5 minutes for optimal analysis
- Use a good microphone for voice recordings
